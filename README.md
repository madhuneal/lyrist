# Lyrist

Lyrist displays the lyrics of the currently-playing iTunes track (or a user-defined track) using [LyricWiki][] on the command line. The iTunes track lyrics feature is currently only available on OS X as it uses AppleScript.

I always have the terminal just a keystroke away (thanks to [TotalTerminal][]), which makes Lyrist very convenient for me; your mileage may vary.

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version][download] and unzip it.
2. Intall [Node][] if you don't have it on your system. You can install it from the [Node website][Node] or alternatively, if you have [Homebrew][], by running `brew install node`.
3. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder where you unzipped Lyrist's source files.
4. Run `make` (this compiles the AppleScript).
5. Run `npm install` (this installs the dependencies).

To easily run the script from anywhere, you can add an alias to it in your bash profile (located at `~/.bash_profile`; you can create it if it doesn't exist) like so:

	alias lyrist="/PATH/TO/lyrist/lyrist.js"
	
I like to run `lyrist`'s output through `less` so I can easily scroll through it:

	alias lyrist="/PATH/TO/lyrist/lyrist.js | less -XRq"

## Usage

Using Lyrist is simple. When a song is playing (or paused) in iTunes, go to the terminal and type the name of the alias you just created above (`lyrist` in this case). Press `enter`. *Voil√†!*

Alternatively, if you want to manually look up a song's lyrics, you can pass it in as an argument like this:

    lyrist '<artist name> - <song title>'
    
For example, `lyrist 'Iron Maiden - Dance of Death'` will look up lyrics for Iron Maiden's *Dance of Death* track.

Note: If you didn't create an alias, navigate to the folder where you unzipped Lyrist and run `./lyrist.js`.
